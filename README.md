# S.T.I.T.C.H.
S.T.I.T.C.H. is a Python program developed to allow users to utilize an interface that gives the user a base to create panels for clothing. The user will have the ability to create a panel from scratch, edit their panel at their command, as well as save their projects and retrieve them to edit them should they decide to change something. I developed the program as a tool to supplement my starting journey into sewing. This will be an accessible tool that I will be using often as I am colorblind and physically disabled at my left hip and femur. My intent is to make this program a creative outlet for pattern making to visualize panels, garments, and outfits quickly and feasibly in one program.
